    "title":`Simulink Model and Simulation of DC Motor Control Using PWM and DC DC converter`,
    "description":`• I utilized Simulink to create a comprehensive model integrating a DC shunt motor and a buck converter. This
simulation allowed for precise control and analysis of the motor’s performance under varying conditions of voltage
regulation and load. By implementing PWM signals within the model, I achieved accurate motor control, simulating
real-world operational scenarios.<br>
• Studied simulation of regenerative braking mode for separately excited DC motor, optimizing energy recovery during
deceleration through controlled motor operation`
